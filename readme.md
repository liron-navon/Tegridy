# Tegridy

Tegridy is a simplified javascript framework written as a part of a medium post.

Tegridy is named after tegridy farms from [SouthPark](http://southpark.cc.com/) (I really 🧡 SouthPark).

To build simply run 
```
npm run build
# OR
npm run build:watch
```

To play around with it you should download [tegridy-playground](https://github.com/liron-navon/tegridy-playground).
You can link between the packages:

```
# in tegridy
npm run build
npm run link

# in tegridy-playground
npm run link tegridy
```
